This directory contains example binary programs build with the FPC crosscompiler as described here.

It is only provided for testing and reference.

DO NOT USE THIS PROGRAMS! They are probably virused/troyanned.
If you insist of trying this exe files (e.g. in a VM or test-only separate machine)
then the archives are packed with password: "this-can-be-virus--to-moze-byc-wirus"
of course without the quotes.
